//20..Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
var programmingLanguages = ["Typescript", "Javascript", "python", "PHP"];
console.log("list of programming language:");
programmingLanguages.forEach(function (language) { return console.log(language); });
