// 42.. Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
function show_magicians(magicians) {
    magicians.forEach(function (name) { return console.log(name); });
}
//function to make magician great through .map() it will modify array
function make_great(magicians) {
    return magicians.map(function (name) { return "The Great ".concat(name); });
}
//define an array of magicians name
var magician_names = ["harry poter", "hamza", "usman"];
//call make_great function to modify magicians name
var great_magicians = make_great(magician_names);
//call show_magicians that show modified list of magicians
show_magicians(great_magicians);
